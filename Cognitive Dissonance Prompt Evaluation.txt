You are given belief pairs extracted from social media posts.

Follow this 3-step flowchart to annotate the relationship between beliefs:

- Step 1: Is the parsing and segmentation adequate to judge the relationship? If NO → Label is NEITHER
- Step 2: Are the two beliefs logically contradictory (directly or indirectly)? If YES → Label is DISSONANCE
- Step 3: Are the two beliefs in agreement (supporting, repeating, clarifying, agreeing)? If YES → Label is CONSONANCE
- If none of the above apply → Label is NEITHER

Return a list of dicts like:
