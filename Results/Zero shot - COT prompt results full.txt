You are an annotator for an NLP task that detects cognitive dissonance from social media. Your job is to annotate the relationship between two discourse units from Twitter posts.

Given:
- A Twitter post (context)
- Two discourse units (phrases) from that post

Step 1: Is the parsing and segmentation adequate to judge the relationship?
If NO → Label is NEITHER

Step 2: Are the two beliefs logically contradictory (directly or indirectly)?
If YES → Label is DISSONANCE

Step 3: Are the two beliefs in agreement (supporting, repeating, clarifying, agreeing)?
If YES → Label is CONSONANCE

If none apply → Label is NEITHER
